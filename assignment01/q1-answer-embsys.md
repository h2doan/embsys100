Using the telegraph example, and the challenges listed in the module as reference, and describe another device that you would like to discuss. Describe how you think its embedded system works, and what design challenges it presents.

*I think a portable personal heart monitor is an embedded system device. Its throughput is the detection of a person's heart pulses within a specified period of time. If it can't detect the heart pulses or reads it too slow, the heart pulses can't be translated accurately to the output. The output may be a read-out to a small screen with the appropriate symbols for human to understand or fed to another device.*

*The heart monitor design is constrained by its size which restricts the amount of hardware and software that can be fitted to the device. The limitation of hardware leads to limited memory size. This, in turn, probably doesn't allow for software upgrade. Additionally, loading the software probably requires special interface.*

*The heart rate monitor must be reliable operating on its own without any or very limited outside intervention. A possible outside intervention which may be provided is a reset button. The heart monitor must also be operated on limited power source for sufficient length of time.*

*Testing and debugging the heart rate monitor are challenging because it may only have a sensor to detect a person's heart rate. It may be very difficult to determine whether the sensor is malfunction or not.*
